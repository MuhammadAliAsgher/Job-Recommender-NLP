# 🔍 Job Recommender NLP: AI-Powered Job & Talent Matching with Sentence-BERT

## 📘 Overview

This project builds an **AI-powered job and resume recommendation engine** using Sentence-BERT embeddings to match resumes with job postings — and vice versa. It was initially developed as a demo on Kaggle to showcase how **semantic similarity** can improve recruitment and job searching over traditional keyword-based systems.

The system has now been enhanced with a **Streamlit web interface** for interactive use and deployment.

It processes a subset of the [LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset (2023-24)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) and the [Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset), recommending the **top 5 matches in both directions**:
- Resumes per job posting (for recruiters)
- Job postings per resume (for job seekers)

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🧠 Bi-Directional Semantic Recommendation Engine
- Matches **1,000 job postings** with **1,000 resumes** using **semantic similarity**
- Recommends:
  - 🔍 Top 5 jobs for an uploaded resume *(job-seeker perspective)*
  - 🧑‍💼 Top 5 resumes for an uploaded job description *(recruiter perspective)*

### ⚙️ Implementation Details
- Built with **Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** for embeddings
- Features:
  - Text preprocessing using **spaCy** (lemmatization, skill/domain extraction)
  - Cosine similarity computation
  - Interactive frontend using **Streamlit**
  - Auto-generation of working files if missing

### 🌟 New Features
- 🎨 **Visually Appealing UI**: Custom-styled Streamlit interface
- 📁 **File Uploads**: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx` for resumes and job descriptions
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Setup**: Automatically creates the working directory if absent
